/*
 * Leetcode 2315
 * You are given a string s, where every two consecutive vertical bars '|' are grouped into a pair.
 In other words, the 1st and 2nd '|' make a pair, the 3rd and 4th '|' make a pair, and so forth.
Return the number of '*' in s, excluding the '*' between each pair of '|'.

Note that each '|' will belong to exactly one pair.

 Example 1:

Input: s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"
Output: 2
Explanation: The considered characters are underlined: "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|".
The characters between the first and second '|' are excluded from the answer.
Also, the characters between the third and fourth '|' are excluded from the answer.
There are 2 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 2.

    int countAsterisks(string s) {


        int count=0;
        int countAsterisks=0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){

                count++;
